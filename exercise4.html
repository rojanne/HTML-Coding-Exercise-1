            I think that I shall never see<br/>
            A poem lovely as a tree.<br/>
            <br/> 
            A tree whose hungry mouth is prest<br/>
            Against the earth’s sweet flowing breast;<br/>
            <br/> 
            A tree that looks at God all day,<br/>
            And lifts her leafy arms to pray;<br/>
            <br/> 
            A tree that may in Summer wear<br/>
            A nest of robins in her hair;<br/>
            <br/> 
            Upon whose bosom snow has lain;<br/>
            Who intimately lives with rain.<br/>
            <br/> 
            Poems are made by fools like me,<br/>
            But only God can make a tree.<br/>
